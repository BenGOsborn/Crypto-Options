-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Test on Kovan
-   Maybe seperate contracts into a trade contract and an option contract
-   Clean up spaghetti code tests + add new lines between tests
-   Test expiry of option somehow ?
