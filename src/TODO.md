-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Write tests on Kovan network + Ganache
    -   [First fork Ethereum mainnet to Ganache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBqS37ffNjE)
    -   [Next deploy smart contract to Ganache/forked mainnet](https://youtu.be/62f757RVEvU?t=842)
    -   [Is there any way to run tests on Ganache by deploying to the existing local blockchain? If this is the case I can make my own startup script](https://youtu.be/G8bDhS24eds)
