-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Maybe seperate contracts into a trade contract and an option contract
-   Deploy to multiple networks with the same ABI
-   MIgrate contract to external, calldata, storage for better gas costs
-   FLAW IN THE CONTRACT - WHAT IF TWO PEOPLE PLACE A TRADE AT THE SAME TIME - MAKE A CURRENT SELLER LIST ???
