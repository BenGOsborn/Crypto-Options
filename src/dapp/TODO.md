-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Maybe seperate contracts into a trade contract and an option contract
-   Deploy to multiple networks with the same ABI
-   Migrate contract to external, calldata, storage for better gas costs

-   Prevent the web socket from adding adding the same item more than once ?
-   Add a price range as a filter
-   Add a way of limiting the size of the tables height
-   Add labels for the different sections
-   Add label to buy section (and maybe even sell section ?)
