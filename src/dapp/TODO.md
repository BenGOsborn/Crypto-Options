-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Maybe seperate contracts into a trade contract and an option contract
-   Deploy to multiple networks with the same ABI
-   MIgrate contract to external, calldata, storage for better gas costs
-   [Add an option to filter back in time more via the blocks for the frontend](https://piyopiyo.medium.com/how-to-get-current-block-number-of-ethereum-blockchain-a4405f77e1b1)
