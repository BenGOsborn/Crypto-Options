-   Implement the market with some kind of stable coin (what would be the problem with trading using ETH if ETH's price fluctuates ?)
-   Test on Rinkeby
-   Maybe seperate contracts into a trade contract and an option contract
-   Frontend
-	Deploy to multiple networks with the same ABI
- Change events
- Option type event is emitting msg.sender instead of the option type
